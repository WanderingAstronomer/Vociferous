Today is Wednesday, March twentieth, twenty-twenty-five, at exactly nine forty-seven a.m. Eastern Standard Time.

I am testing automatic speech recognition under normal conversational pacing, with deliberate changes in cadence, emphasis, and clarity.

The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog — twice — and then pauses.

For numbers, listen carefully: zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen.
Twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty, ninety, one hundred.
One thousand, ten thousand, one hundred thousand, one million.

Decimal numbers follow: three point one four one five nine.
Version numbers follow: version two dot seven dot four, build one zero five zero.

Percentages and symbols next.
CPU usage peaked at ninety-seven percent.
Battery charge dropped to twelve percent.
Network latency averaged thirty-two milliseconds.

Here are acronyms spoken deliberately:
CPU, GPU, RAM, SSD, NVMe, TLS, HTTPS, SSH, VPN, DNS.

Now company and product names:
OpenAI, GitHub, Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, PostgreSQL again with emphasis,
JetBrains IntelliJ, Visual Studio Code, Docker Compose, NVIDIA RTX thirty-ninety.

Homophones matter here:
There, their, and they’re are three different words.
To, too, and two are also different.
Its and it’s are not the same.

I will now read a short technical sentence:
The Java backend communicates with the React frontend through a RESTful API secured by OAuth two point zero and JSON Web Tokens.

Pause.

Now a spelling test spoken naturally, not letter by letter:
Quarkus, Panache, Hibernate, asynchronous, containerization.

A mild tongue-twister follows:
She sells secure shells on secure shell servers.

I will briefly change tone and speed.
THIS SENTENCE IS LOUDER AND MORE EMPHATIC.
this sentence is quieter and slower.

Finally, punctuation matters in this last line:
Hello, world! Are you reading this correctly—or not? Let’s find out.

End of transcription test.
